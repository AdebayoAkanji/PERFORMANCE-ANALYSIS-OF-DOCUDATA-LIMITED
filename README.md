INTRODUCTION

The objective of this analysis is to gain insights into sales performance and trends to make informed decisions. This will help the business to stay competitive and responsive to market demands. This include understanding products that are performing well as against the products that are not. Also I evaluate the efficiency of current sales tactics and refine them for better results. I was able to also identify the preference and purchasing habits of customer to encourage continuous patronage.
Products and regions that are not performing well is identified so that the applicable correctional techniques are introduced for improvement. From this analysis I was able to know where to focus attention and how to implement strategies that has worked effectively in areas of excellent performance.
Some of the dataset used in the sales analysis include Revenue, Sales amount, Product category, Product name, Customer names, region and cities. The methodology engaged are Data Cleaning, Data visualization, Pivot Table using Microsoft Excel.

The data originated from a public data set through the mentor. The data structure has the column representing different variables such as customer name, revenue, region, city, product name and the likes, while the rows represent different transactions by customers.
The important features in this sales analysis include the revenue, product category, region, city, customer name and product name. The revenue and region is very important in determining the income generated from the location while the product category helps to denote the best performing products category.
Although a number of inconsistencies was discovered after observing the data, some of which are missing data in a cell, missing rows which was corrected by deleting the row completely. Data duplicate was also discovered on the data sets and was corrected using Microsoft Excel.
Select the dataset, then click on Data tab and choose remove duplicates then confirm that the duplicate is removed.

Data Cleaning was conducted by me in order to have a consistent dataset. For instance, missing rows were corrected by deleting the row completely. This is to avoid wrong analysis. Data duplicate was also discovered on the data sets and was corrected using Microsoft Excel.
Select the dataset, then click on Data tab and choose remove duplicates then confirm that the duplicate is removed.
After this process of cleaning the dataset, I converted the data set to a standard excel table for accuracy and easy automation.
